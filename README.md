# Tableau-Project
Description: Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Sample Superstore
dataset
• Analyzed key metrics such as sales, profit, and total orders across categories,
sub-categories, regions, segments, and top products. Performed year-wise analysis and
identified sales trends for data-driven insights.
• Created multiple parameters and calculated fields to dynamically filter data, enhance
user interactions, and perform complex calculations, increasing the flexibility and
depth of the dashboard's analytical capabilities.
